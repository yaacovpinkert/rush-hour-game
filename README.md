# Rush Hour Game

A Python project implementing the Rush Hour puzzle game for Intro2CS Exercise 9 at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
The main idea behind this exercise is to get familiar with **Object-Oriented Programming**.


## Usage

To run the game:

```bash
python game.py <car_config.json>
```

This will load the car configuration from the JSON file and start the console-based game. The console will show the board and possible moves at each turn.
